# UFOs
Module 11 - JavaScript

## Overview
The purpose of this code is to help Dana build a dynamic website to share the UFO sightings database with others, and adding a set of filters to find specific UFO sightings.

This code uses 6 different dymanic filters (Date, City, State, Country and Shape) to limit the output of the data for a specific results.

### Resources
Javascript
HTML
CSS


## Results
 The results yield a filtered output from the UFO database of UFO sightings. To filter, the user must type the desired filter into one for many of the filter prompt boxes on the left side of the page and press enter to execute. Filters can either be cleared by deleting the input from the filter boxes or refreshing the page.

 Please see the screenshot below of the final website for Dana's project.

## Summary
 One drawback to this design is that the filters have to be an absolute match in order to product results. Any sort of misspelling or added symbols will cause the filter to fail in finding matches in the database. I think for this it would be helpful to see a dropdown list for eaach of the filters and exsisting elements, that way if there is not a match then you do not have to waste time searching for specific criteria that does not exist.  Another way to solve this issue would be to have actively updating filters, so the results would begin to filter as you are typing rather than requiring a completed input.

### Recommendations
(1) I would widen the scope of a date period filter, add the functionality for a date range by month and year as opposed to a specific day, or perhaps options for "In the last Month" or "In the last Year". If the database could be changed to real time, this would give you a much easier way to understand whats going on with UFO. In addition to this, I think a very beneficial addition would be to add a sort funtion to the header list so you can sort by date or any of the column titles to see the output in a particular order.

(2) My second reccomendation which would make this website even more dynamic would be to attach the coordinates to the city and add a filterable map to the webpage. This could also include one additional filter that allows you to set a distance, so you can search for "Denver" but get a point on a map and the UFO sighting info for any spotting within 100 miles. I think that would be cool.
